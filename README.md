# Agfa Healthcare | Scheduling System 

To run this application from its source code, you must host it locally. To do this, you can download MAMP or XAMPP and start the MySQL and Apache services. For files that make use of a SQL database, you will need to change the username and password to match your settings on MAMP or XAMPP. By default, the username and password for MAMP is "root" "root" (see image below). For XAMPP, the default username is "root" while the password is left empty.

Once these services are running/implemented, you can open the application by appending the port number used by MAMP/XAMPP to "localhost". By default, this is "localost:8888" on MAMP, or just "localhost" on XAMPP (see image below)

The SQL database/tables intended for use with this application are available within the repository and can be used by importing them with the phpmyadmin service. You can visit this service by appending "phpmyadmin5" to the end of your localhost url. Once within the service, you can use the import feature to import the SQL files provided, or create your own tables for use based on the structures provided in the images below.
